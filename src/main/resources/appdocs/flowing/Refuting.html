<p>Always, the winner(s) of a debate will have <i>attacked</i> the opposing cases' premises/evidence/etc. This is known as refuting.</p>
<p>In order to visually refute what an opponent said, you must proceed with the following instructions:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Select the part(s) of the opponents speech that you wish to refute, using your mouse or arrow keys.</li>
    <li>Press <code>R</code> while holding down <code>CTRL</code></li>
    <li>Type your response in the prompt provided. This response can include solely reasoning/presentation of logical
    fallacies in this case. However, it can also include evidence used to support your stance. There cards
    would be embedded by putting a <code>;</code> before the card name, and then either writing out the card name or auto
    completing it.</li>
    <li>Press <code>Enter</code> while holding down <code>CTRL</code> in order to submit your response.*</li>
</ol>

<p style="font-size: 12px"><i>* Note that without the <code>CTRL</code> key held down, a new line is put in the prompt itself.</i></p>

<p>The application will now link the refutation part of your speech to the construction part of your opponent's case. When you view
your speech in presentation mode, this link will be taken note of and your response will be presented as a direct counter to your
opponent's points.</p>
