# PFFlowing
A note-taking application specialized for high school public forum debate.

The public forum debate format can be found [here](https://debate.uvm.edu/dcpdf/PFNFL.pdf), and PFFlowing incorporates an interface that
supports multiple components of this format, including:

1. Speaker-specific, side-specific notes (with each column representing a side of one speaker). For example, there is a dedicated column
for recording what the second speaker on the pro side says against the con.

2. An easy interface to import evidence from a variety of formats, including offline documents as well as documents stored through Google Drive. This evidence
can then be dragged and dropped into one of the above mentioned columns to supplemnt the user-created notes.

3. Bluetooth support, in order to synchronize your notes with your parter in the debate environment (where internet use can be prohibited).

4. A variety of actions to manipulate your notes, including an undo/redo edit system, merging notes in order to later address them as one component of the speech,
refuting speaker points contained in the notes and marking notes as targets for cross examination. 

5. A global configuration, supporting changes in font family, font size and font color for each side.

6. A built-in help menu to assist users in maximizing their productivity with PFFlowing.
